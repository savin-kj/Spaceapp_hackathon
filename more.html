    <p class="para">Nidavellir-B orbits around a K-type star called Nedaviller,which is less massive and cooler than our Sun. This star provides the necessary conditions for super habitable exoplanets, which are exoplanets that could be more habitable than Earth.It is the fourth planet in the Nidar system.The system consists of 7 planets out of which 4 are rocky and 3 are gaseous.
        Nidavellir-B is located in the habitable zone of its star, also known as the Goldilocks’ zone. This is the distance from the star at which liquid water could exist on a planets’ surface. The conditions on Nidavellir B are just right – neither too hot nor too cold – for life.
        Nidavellir-B is similar in size to Earth, falling within the range of 1 to 2.5 Earth radii. This makes it a rocky planet &  is  favorable for life.Life on Nidavellir is adapted to its unique conditions. The organisms are evolved to utilize the different light spectrum emitted by its K-type star.
        They have developed unique photosynthetic processes, leading to plants with colors like red,purple.Due to the presence of anthocyanin,lycopene,phycoerythrin,chlorophyll etc,the planet has a very diverse and colorful vegetation..The climate on Nidavellir B would be milder than Earth’s due to the lower luminosity of its K-type star. This could result in less extreme seasonal variations, creating a more stable environment where life can thrive.Life in Nidavellir B is more diverse than in earth,organisms which look similar to humans but are not exactly alike. They have big heads, long arms ,short legs and also a tail. Since it orbits around a k type star,the organisms lack melanin which results in organisms with green colored skin.
        The sky of Nidavellir-B would be a different color due to the star’s lower temperature and redder light. At sunset, instead of the red and orange hues we see on Earth, inhabitants might witness a spectacular display of deep reds, purples, and blues.
        In conclusion, while Nidavellir-B is different from Earth in many ways, these differences make it a unique and potentially habitable world. Life on Nidavellir-B would be adapted to these conditions, resulting in a rich and diverse biosphere that is both alien and familiar.</p>
